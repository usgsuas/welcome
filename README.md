# Welcome!

These resources are for USGS personnel involved in sUAS activities. 

## How do I request access?
USGS users can send an email from their usgs.gov email account to jdadams@usgs.gov or cbdawson@usgs.gov

## What is a "USGS user"?
For the purposes of this usgsuas site on github.com, a "USGS user" is defined as an individual with an active usgs.gov email account. The user's gitub account must be associated with their official USGS duties (typically indicated as username-usgs) and their official usgs.gov email address. If a USGS user does not currently have a github account, they can sign up for a free individual user account at github.com (use your @usgs.gov email address).
